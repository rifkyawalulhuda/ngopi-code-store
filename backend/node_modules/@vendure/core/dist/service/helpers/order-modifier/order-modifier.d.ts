 * @description
 * This helper is responsible for modifying the contents of an Order.
 *
 * Note:
 * There is not a clear separation of concerns between the OrderService and this, since
 * the OrderService also contains some method which modify the Order (e.g. removeItemFromOrder).
 * So this helper was mainly extracted to isolate the huge `modifyOrder` method since the
 * OrderService was just growing too large. Future refactoring could improve the organization
 * of these Order-related methods into a more clearly-delineated set of classes.
